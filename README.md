# Example of a Bridgetown website with a "Rails Nano" backend API

More documentation and hopefully a Railsbyte/Bridgetown automation/etc. coming soon!

Basically, run `bundle install` and `yarn install` and then `yarn start` and boom, you have a static website powered by Bridgetown
communicating with a Rails API all in one repo. Also cool: it's a single Rack app stack served by Puma, so you can deploy to a
Ruby-friendly host or use a Docker mesh like Fly.io and get the whole enchilada up and running in no time flat!
